## Background

Superface (super-interface) is a higher-order API, an abstraction on top of the modern APIs like GraphQL and REST. Superface is one interface to discover, connect, and query any capabilities available via conventional APIs. 

Through its focus on application-level semantics, Superface decouples the clients from servers, enabling fully autonomous evolution. As such it minimizes the code base as well as errors and downtimes while providing unmatched resiliency and redundancy. 

Superface allows for switching capability providers without development at a runtime in milliseconds. Furthermore, Superface decentralizes the composition and aggregation, and thus creates an Autonomous Integration Mesh.

Motivation behind Superface is nicely described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvq3NXFb94) from APIdays conference.

You can get more information at https://superface.ai and https://docs.superface.ai/.

## Install

To install this package just install the cli globally using one of the following commands:

```shell
# if using yarn
yarn global add @superfaceai/cli
# otherwise
npm install --global @superfaceai/cli
```

Or you can use NPX directly with Superface CLI commands:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli [command]
# eg. you can quickly start with Superface CLI and our curated capabilities 
npx @superfaceai/cli install [profileId eg. communication/send-email] -i
```

## Usage

  <!-- commands -->
* [`superface configure PROVIDERNAME`](#superface-configure-providername)
* [`superface install [PROFILEID]`](#superface-install-profileid)

## `superface configure PROVIDERNAME`

Automatically initializes superface directory in current working directory if needed, communicates with Superface Store API, stores provider configuration in super.json

```
USAGE
  $ superface configure PROVIDERNAME

ARGUMENTS
  PROVIDERNAME  Provider name.

OPTIONS
  -f, --force            When set to true and when provider exists in super.json, overwrites them.
  -h, --help             show CLI help
  -l, --local            When set to true, provider name argument is used as a filepath to provider.json file
  -p, --profile=profile  (required) Specifies profile to associate with provider
  -q, --quiet            When set to true, disables the shell echo output of init actions.

EXAMPLES
  $ superface configure twilio -p send-sms
  $ superface configure twilio -p send-sms -q
  $ superface configure twilio -p send-sms -f
  $ superface configure providers/twilio.provider.json -p send-sms -l
```

_See code: [src/commands/configure.ts](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli/tree/main/src/commands/configure.ts)_

## `superface install [PROFILEID]`

Automatically initializes superface directory in current working directory if needed, communicates with Superface Store API, stores profiles and compiled files to a local system. Install without any arguments tries to install profiles and providers listed in super.json

```
USAGE
  $ superface install [PROFILEID]

ARGUMENTS
  PROFILEID  Profile identifier consisting of scope (optional), profile name and its version.

OPTIONS
  -f, --force                When set to true and when profile exists in local filesystem, overwrites them.
  -h, --help                 show CLI help

  -i, --interactive          When set to true, command is used in interactive mode. It leads users through profile
                             installation, provider selection, provider security and retry policy setup. Result of this
                             command is ready to use superface configuration.

  -l, --local                When set to true, profile id argument is used as a filepath to profile.supr file.

  -p, --providers=providers  Provider name.

  -q, --quiet                When set to true, disables the shell echo output of init actions.

  -s, --scan=scan            When number provided, scan for super.json outside cwd within range represented by this
                             number.

EXAMPLES
  $ superface install
  $ superface install sms/service -i
  $ superface install sms/service@1.0 -i
  $ superface install sms/service@1.0
  $ superface install sms/service@1.0 --providers twilio tyntec
  $ superface install sms/service@1.0 -p twilio
  $ superface install --local sms/service.supr
```

## Interactive install

CLI install command can be used in interactive mode by using `-i` flag. It leads users through profile installation, provider selection, provider security and retry policy setup. Result of this command is ready to use superface configuration. Steps of command are:
      
1) Superface is initialized (if not already initialized)
      
2) Selected profile installation - if profile already exists users can choose if they want to override existing 
   installation
      
3) Select providers and install them. Users can choose to override or skip already existing providers
      
4) If profile contains more than one use case users can select use case to configure
      
5) If there is more than one provider configured users can choose to enable provider failover (in case of problems 
   with primary provider superface automatically switches to secondary provider)
      
6) For every selected provider users can choose retry policy he want provider to use. Currently there are two 
   supported retry policies:
      
    * None: superface won't retry any requests
      
    * CircuitBreaker: superface will try retry requests, each request has timeout and exponential backoff is used between 
      failed requests. Parameters of circuit breaker can be specifed or left default.
      
7) Installed providers are configured. Users can set enviroment variables needed for provider authorization. These 
   are saved locally in .env file.
      
8) Package @superfaceai/one-sdk is installed. This package is needed to use superface.
      
9) Optionally, package dotenv is installed to load .env file
      
10) Optionally, users can enter SDK token to connect superface installation with his dashboard and to enable e-mail 
    notifications
      
11) Superface is configured ðŸ†—. Users can follow printed link to get actual code

## Security

Superface is not man-in-the-middle so it does not require any access to secrets that are needed to communicate with provider API. Superface CLI only prepares super.json file with authorization fields in form of environment variable. You just set correct variables and communicate directly with provider API.

You can find more information in [SDK repository](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Support

If you need any additional support, have any questions or you just want to talk you can do that through our [documentation page](https://docs.superface.ai). 

## Development

When developing, start with cloning the repository using `git clone https://github.com/superfaceai/cli.git` (or `git clone git@github.com:superfaceai/cli.git` if you have repository access).

After cloning, the dependencies must be downloaded using `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Now the repository is ready for code changes.

The `package.json` also contains scripts (runnable by calling `yarn <script-name>` or `npm run <script-name>`):
- `test` - run all tests
- `lint` - lint the code (use `lint --fix` to run autofix)
- `format` - check the code formatting (use `firmat:fix` to autoformat)
- `prepush` - run `test`, `lint` and `format` checks. This should run without errors before you push anything to git.

Lastly, to build a local artifact run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

To install a local artifact globally, symlink the binary (`ln -s bin/superface <target>`) into one of the following folders:

- `~/.local/bin` - local binaries for your user only (may not be in `PATH` yet)
- `/usr/local/bin` - system-wide binaries installed by the system administrator
- output of `yarn global bin` - usually the same as `/use/local/bin`

**Note**: The project needs to be built (into the `dist` folder) to run cli commands.

**Note**: You can change url of API requests by setting `SUPERFACE_API_URL` environment variable to desired base url.
